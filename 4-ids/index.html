        <p class="imani">Hello.</p>
        <p class="carmen">Whassup...</p>
        <p class="imani">Carmen, I think you might be my best friend.</p>
        <p class="carmen">Shut up.</p>
        <p class="imani">I'm serious! Be serious!</p>
        <p class="carmen">I guess I'm supposed to be flattered.</p>
        <p class="imani">You ARE supposed to be flattered, you jerk!</p>
        <p class="carmen">OK. You never get mad at me. So I'm taking this seriously.</p>
        <p class="imani">Good...</p>
        <p class="imani">So, is it weird that I think you're my best friend?</p>
        <p class="carmen">It's cool! But what am I, a psychologist?</p>
        <p class="imani">I just don't know how I feel about it. I guess it doesn't matter. It just is.</p>
        <p class="carmen">I like that. I found ten bucks. Let's go get tacos.</p>

        <p class="imani">Hello, Carmen.</p>
        <p class="carmen">Whassup, Imani...</p>
        <p class="imani">Are you going to that party tonight?</p>
        <p class="imani">I think I'm going to make pizzas and bring them.</p>
        <p class="imani">Hello... Carmen... I'm talking to you. Are you in there?</p>
        <p class="carmen">Sorry I can't stop thinking about this design system I'm building.</p>
        <p class="carmen">I was going to go to the party... But... There's a new documentary about Javascript out.</p>
        <p class="carmen">I think Javascript might win over pizza tonight.</p>
        <p class="imani">Wow, Carmen. You are a SERIOUS design nerd.</p>
        <p class="imani">Will you go with me if I let you bring your laptop?</p>
        <p class="carmen">Oh my gosh. Am I that bad?</p>
        <p class="imani">YES. YOU ARE THAT BAD!</p>
