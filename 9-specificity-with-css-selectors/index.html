    <!-- Module 9! Specificity with CSS Selectors
        We reviewed the specificity CSS files give us. Whatever is read last by the browser is applied.
        
        But our selectors also give us specificity.
        Remember in a previous modules we learned about IDs, Classes, and Elements.

        In CSS files, 
        - IDs start with a # 
        - Classes start with a .
        - Elements simply use the name of the HTML element, such as div, h3, p, etc.

        These three things have specificities as well.
        - IDs are more specific than classes.
        - Classes are more specfic than Elements.
        - Elements are the least specific.
        
        Notice there are two h3 elements below and they look like this
        <h3 id="heading-one" class="header">The Power of Getting Tacos</h3>
        <h3 id="heading-two" class="header">Is Veggie Deluxe... Deluxe Enough?</h3>

        The h3 elements have unique ids and also a class called "header"

        Look at index.html in the browser.
        "The Power of Getting Tacos" is blue.
        "Is Veggie Deluxe... Deluxe Enough?" is purple.

        Take a look at our styles.css. You'll see the following style selectors in the file.
        A #heading-one ID selector, a .header class selector, and an h3 element selector.

        #heading-one {
            color: blue;
        }

        .header {
           color: purple;
        }

        h3 {
            font-size: 26px;
            color: pink;
        }


        Our ID of #heading-one is the most specific.
        This turns the text "The Power of Getting Tacos" to blue.
        But lets start at the very beginning to understand the steps that it took to get to blue.

        1. As our index.html file was first being run, our text could have been black becuase that is the default text color.
        2. After our css files loaded, our text could have been turned pink becuase it has an h3 element.
        3. Our text could have been turned to purple becuase it has the .header class.
        4. But this text was set to blue becuase the #heading-one ID is the most specific. ID's will always win!

        Next, you'll see that "Is Veggie Deluxe... Deluxe Enough?" is purple.
        Lets start at the very beginning to understand the steps that it took to get to blue.

        1. As our index.html file was first being run, our text could have been black becuase that is the default text color.
        2. After our css files loaded, our text could have been turned pink becuase it has an h3 element.
        3. Then our text WAS turned to purple becuase it has the .header class.
        4. Our text does have an ID of #heading-two which is the most specific, but we don't have any style called #heading-two in our styles.css.
           Becuase we don't have any style for #heading-two, to the .header class is the most specific style!

        
        OK. Get ready to nerd out for a few minutes. You ready? Here we go!
        Here's how the browser figures out the correct specificity for each selector.

        The browser uses three columns to determine specificity. We start with column 3 on the left and go to 1, like 3-2-1.
        These three columns map to ID, Class, Element.


        Let's Review Slot 3: IDs
        Slots 3-2-1
              ^
        If we have an ID we put a 1 in the first slot.

        Let's Review Slot 2: Classes
        Slots 3-2-1
                ^
        For each classes (and pseudo-classes, we'll talk about those later.) we put a 1 in the second slot.

        Let's Review Slot 1: Elements
        Slots 3-2-1
                  ^
        For each element type we put a 1 in the third slot.

        OK. Back to our example...
        
        #heading-one {
            color: blue;
        }

        .header {
           color: purple;
        }

        h3 {
            font-size: 26px;
            color: pink;
        }
    
        Let's "See what the browser sees" when specificity is being calculated.

        1-0-0 is the column weighting for this ID selector

        #heading-one {
            color: blue;
        }

        0-1-0 is the column weighting for this class selector

        .header {
           color: purple;
        }

        0-0-1 is the column weighting for this element selector

        h3 {
            font-size: 26px;
            color: pink;
        }
    
        I encourage you to play around with Keegan Street's specificity calculator https://specificity.keegan.st/

        OK. But there's more to it! 
        There are two _special cases_ to know about when figuring out specificity.

        The first special case is for the !important keyword.
        If you add !important to any of your selectors it will be given the highest priority. All others lose.
        Most designers consider !important a dangerous or at least very very annoying thing to use, so let's skip it for now.

        This is an example of !important value on a .header class selector just so you can see what it looks like
        
        .header {
           color: greenyellow !important;
        } 

        Again, you should try to never use !important except in emergencies. They almost always cause headaches.
        
        The second special case is inline styles!
        Inline styles will win out over .css file styles UNLESS !important is used in the .css style.
        
        Here's one of our h3 examples with a hotpink inline style applied.

        <h3 id="heading-one" style="color: hotpink;">The Power of Getting Tacos<h3>
        
        This inline style="color: hotpink" is going be more specific than your id="heading-one" style.
        So the browser will style your text will be hotpink.

        To recap, here is the specificity order from most specific to least specific.
        !important
        inline style
        id
        class
        element

        I tried to think of an mnemonic for remembering this acronym but it is already !iice which is.. kinda good? All those i's though.
        "Don't slip on the !-i-ice" Hrm... maybe this will help us remember?

        If this feels a little bit... much... you're not wrong. I do promise that it is worth knowing.
        As you start working on more complex projects these specificity calculations become a very useful debugging tool.
        It is easy to spend an hour pulling your hair out wondering why your CSS style isn't working. Doing the specificity calculation can save a ton of time.

        A couple of tips: 
        Chrome's "Dev Tools" sorts classes by their specificity from top-to-bottom. This is a great way to understand which style is winning.
        Safari's "Develop Tool" Web Inspector will show you the Specificity: (0,0,0) number if you hover over the selector.


        OK! Now it's your turn.
        In this html file, add an inline style with color: red to the line
        <p class="imani">You ARE supposed to be flattered, you jerk!</p>

        What class loses to the specificity of the inline style?
         
        Step 2. Add color: black !important; to the p element selector in styles.css. Which styles to the specificity of the p selector with the !important property?
