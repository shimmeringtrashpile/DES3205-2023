  Lesson 2!
  Let's talk about color.
  
  In Lesson 1 we used the name of a color inside our p selector to style our p element.
  p {
      color: blueviolet;
  }

  There's 148 color names. These are called the 'Named Colors.'
  The most recently added Named Color is rebeccapurple. I'll let you do a web search to find out who Rebecca is.

  OK. Named Colors... Great. But there's only 148! That isn't very many!
  There are other ways to define colors in CSS. I'll share a few ways here.


  RGBA Color
  A second way to create a color value in CSS is to use red green blue (rgb) values.
  These values go from 0 to 255. There some computer science-y reasons for this 0 to 255 range we won't get into righht now.

  Our blueviolet color in RGB is rgb(138, 43, 226)

  p {
      color: rgb(138, 43, 226);
  }

  I often think of this in percentages of our base red, green blue. 
  
  Our color is blueviolet so there's going to be a lot of blue color, some red color and not very much green.
  Our number 138, 43, 226 matches this.


  138 out of 255 is 138/255 = .54 or 54% red.
                     43/255 = .17 or 17% green.
                    226/255 = .89 or 89% blue. 
  
  Yep! That is definitely a purpley-blue color!

  Notice on line 18 I said RGBA color. So what about that A?
  A is for our alpha channel! We get transparancy with RGBA color!
  Note: This last digit is a bit different. It doesn't go all the way from 0 to 255. It only goes between 0 and 1!
  0 is totally transparent. 1 is totally opaque. So half opacity is .5!

  So our blueviolet color with full opacity is

  p {
      color: rgba(138, 43, 226, 1);
  }

  Note that when opacity is full, we should just drop the a entirely.
  
  p {
    color: rgb(138, 43, 226);
  }

  But if we want to show our blueviolet color with half opacity we would use the a.

  p {
      color: rgba(138, 43, 226, .5);
  }


  OK! Named Color and RGBA are done! That was two different types of ways to express color. We have two left to go!


  HEX Color
  The third and still most popular way to add color values in CSS is by using HEX values.
  Our color blueviolet can be described as a hexidecimal value using #8A2BE2.

  p {
      color: #8A2BE2;
  }

  I find hex color to be the hardest to understand but I think we can get there together.
  Hex color codes always start with a pound sign or hashtag (#) and are followed by six letters and/or numbers.

  
  The first two of the six characters are for red.
  The next two of the six characters are for green
  The last two of the six characters refer to blue. 
  
  The color values for each of the red, green and blue amounts are defined in values between 00 and FF.
  This is weird. I know.

  Numbers are used for values 1 through 9. Then letters are use to represent values 10 through 15.
  I list them out. I think this helps.

  0 = 0
  1 = 1
  2 = 2
  3 = 3
  4 = 4
  5 = 5
  6 = 6
  7 = 7
  8 = 8
  9 = 9
  A = 10
  B = 11
  C = 12
  D = 13
  E = 14
  F = 15

  A reminder that we call this system hexadecimal. Hexa for 6 and decimal for 10. This is a base 16 numbering system!

  I think an example helps
  I'll use the color red here to explain.
  Pure red is the hex value #FF0000
  Let's break #FF0000 into our 6 characters total: F, F, 0, 0, 0, and 0.

  The first and second two characters are for our red value. FF
  The third and fourth characters are for our green value. 00
  The fifth and sixth characters are for our blue value. 00

  The formula for turning one of our hex pairs into a number is as follows

  Step 1. Multiply the first character by 16.
  If we do that, the first character is F, which is 15. So we do 15 x 16 = 240.

  Step 2. Multiply the second character by 1.
  If we do that, the second character is also F, which is 15. So we do 15 x 1 = 15.

  Step 3. Add the first number to the second number.
  Adding the two totals together: 240 + 15 = 255

  Ah ha! Look at our friend rgb color! 255 means the maximum of a color!
  In rgb, red is rgb(255, 0, 0) in hex it is #FF0000
  If we perform the hexadecimal calcuation we learn that FF is hex for 255!
  It's the same system just expressed differently!

  You might be asking, do I really need to do all that math? The answer is no. There's plenty of converters online.
  But it is useful as a gut check to understand how the system works.

  For example, 
  #FF0000 should be easily understood as pure red or rgb(255, 0, 0).
  #00FF00 should be easily understood as pure green or rgb(0, 255, 0).
  #0000FF should be easily understood as pure blue or rgb(0, 0, 255).


  Is there an Alpha? No. There isn't. This is a downside of the Hex Color and Named Color systems.



  And for our final act, let's talk about HSLA Color!

  HSLA stands for Hue, Saturation, and Lightness and we get our friend Alpha for transparency.

  Our blueviolet in hsl is hsl(271, 76%, 53%)

  Notice that first number is a number the second and third numbers are percentages.

  Let's take Hue first. 
  Hue is a degree on the color wheel from 0 to 360. 
  0 (and 360) is red.
  120 is green.
  240 is blue.

  Saturation is the intensity of the color described as a percentage from 0% to 100%.
  100% is full color, no gray. 
   50% is 50% gray, and you still get the color. 
    0% is totally gray. No color.

  Lightness is our third number. Lightness is how much light you give the color. 

    0% means no light (totally dark)
   50% means 50% light.
  100% means full light.

  Alpha starts at 0.0 (fully transparent) and goes up to 1.0 (not transparent at all).
  Alpha in HSLA is described with two digits. This is a bit different than in our RGBA system.

In CSS we add the alpha value on much like we do in RGBA. We only use show it when we need it.

p {
  color:  hsla(271, 76%, 53%, 0.8);
}
*/

p {
    color: blueviolet;
    text-align: center;
    font-size: 18px;
    background-color: lemonchiffon;
}


/* OK! Now it's your turn. You're going to modify that p selector code above.
Step 1: Change the color value to the rgb value that represents the indigo named color.
Step 2: Change the background-color value to the hsl color that represents the lemonchiffon named color.
