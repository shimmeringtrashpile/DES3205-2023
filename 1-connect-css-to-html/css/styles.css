/* 
  Welcome to the CSS file!
  CSS files are commonly named 'style.css' or 'styles.css' You can name it whatever you want.
  CSS files are were you create your design rules for your html. 
  These design rules are called selectors. 
  These selectors hold stuff in between {}, also known as curly braces.
  The stuff in these curly braces must be pairs of text called 'property value pairs.'
  I realize that sounds like some sort of real estate thing! But let's keep going and it should start to make sense.
  A property can be something like 'color,' for a text color like blueviolet.
                                or 'align,' for text alignments like left right and center.
                                or 'font-size' for things like 16px.
  You computer understands that you've given it a property value pair when it sees a :, also known as a colon.
  Here's the structure of a selector that contains three property value pairs. 
  It's the template your computer is looking for to take your design rule and apply it to your html.

selector {
  property1: valueA
  property2: valueB
  property3: valueC
} 

This is just the template though. Let's make an actual useful selector!
As we know, text is the most basic component of design.
Most html files have body copy. 
Web browser's know, "When I see a tag with the p element inside, <p></p>, that's body copy!"
The letter p stands for paragraph.
CSS understands these basic html elements such as p, body, head, a, etc and we can use these to style our page.
The letter 'p' is the paragraph selector for the p HTML element.
Go take a look at the <p></p> tags in your index.html file and come back.

When we create a p selector in our CSS file, we are creating a design rule that wil be applied to every <p> tag in our html file.
An empty pe selector won't do anything, though. Boring!
p {

}

Let's get fany and add some properties inside this 'p' selector.

p {
    color: blueviolet;
    text-align: left;
    font-size: 18px;
}

This will do three things to the text that lives inside our html <p></p> tags. It will: 
- Change the font color from black (the default) to blueviolet, 
- Align the text left, 
- Set the font size from 16px (the default) to 18px!

p {
    color: blueviolet;
    text-align: left;
    font-size: 18px;
}

p {
    color: blueviolet;
    /* color: #8A2BE2;
  color: rgb(138,43,226); */
}
