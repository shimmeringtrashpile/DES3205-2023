    <!-- notice 'css' is our folder that contains our 'styles.css' file.
         The 'rel' attribute stands for relationship. 
         There's a bunch of options for the rel but we only care about 'stylesheet.'

        <p>This text is inside an html tag with a &lt;p&gt; tag.
            <p>We have a 'p' selector in our styles.css file the the property value pair of 'color: blueviolet;' so our text is blueviolet.
                <p>Our 'p' selector is also setting our text-alignment to left 'text-alignment: left;' so our text is left-justified in the browswer.</p>
                <p>Also, our font-size has been increased to 18 pixels (px). The browser's default font-size is 16px. If we didn't define a font-size property, we would be seeing this text at 16px.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Hey we've got another &lt;p&gt; tag down here! The p selector in our styles.css file is also styling this paragraph.</p>
