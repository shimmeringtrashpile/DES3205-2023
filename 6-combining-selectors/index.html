        <p class="imani">Hello.</p>
        <p class="carmen">Whassup...</p>
        <p class="imani">Carmen, I think you might be my best friend.</p>
        <p class="carmen">Shut up.</p>
        <p class="imani">I'm serious! Be serious!</p>
        <p class="carmen">I guess I'm supposed to be flattered.</p>
        <p class="imani">You ARE supposed to be flattered, you jerk!</p>
        <p class="carmen">OK. You never get mad at me. So I'm taking this seriously.</p>
        <p class="imani">Good...</p>
        <p class="imani">So, is it weird that I think you're my best friend?</p>
        <p class="carmen">It's cool! But what am I, a psychologist?</p>
        <p class="imani">I just don't know how I feel about it. I guess it doesn't matter. It just is.</p>
        <p class="carmen">I like that. I found ten bucks. Let's go get tacos.</p>

        <p class="imani">Hello, Carmen.</p>
        <p class="carmen">Whassup, Imani...</p>
        <p class="imani">Are you going to that party tonight?</p>
        <p class="imani">I think I'm going to make pizzas and bring them.</p>
        <p class="imani">Hello... Carmen... I'm talking to you! Are you in there?</p>
        <p class="carmen">Sorry I can't stop thinking about design systems.</p>
        <p class="carmen">I was going to go to the party... But there's a new documentary about Javascript out.</p>
        <p class="carmen">I think Javascript might win over pizza.</p>
        <p class="imani">Wow. You are a serious design nerd.</p>
        <p class="imani">Will you go with me if I let you bring your laptop?</p>
        <p class="carmen">Oh my gosh. Am I that bad?</p>
        <p class="imani">YES. YOU ARE THAT BAD!</p>
        <p class="carmen">Wait, you're making pizzas?</p>
        <p class="imani">Uh... That's what I said!</p>
        <p class="carmen">Are you making that veggie deluxe kind you made a while back?</p>
        <p class="imani">Will you go if I do?</p>
        <p class="imani">Wait. No. Will you go and leave your laptop at home if I do?</p>
        <p class="carmen">Hrm... OK. OK. You've convinced me. No. Your pizza has convinced me!</p>
