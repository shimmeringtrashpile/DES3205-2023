        <p class="imani">Hello... Carmen... Are you in there?</p>
        <p class="carmen">Sorry I can't stop thinking about design systems.</p>
        <p class="carmen">I was going to go to the party... But there's a new documentary about Javascript out.</p>
        <p class="carmen">I think Javascript might win over pizza.</p>
        <p class="imani">Wow. You are a serious design nerd.</p>
        <p class="imani">Will you go with me if I let you bring your laptop?</p>
        <p class="carmen">Oh my gosh. Am I that bad?</p>
        <p class="imani">YES. YOU ARE THAT BAD!</p>
        <p class="carmen">Wait, you're making pizzas?</p>
        <p class="imani">Uh... That's what I said!</p>
        <p class="carmen">Are you making that veggie deluxe kind you made a while back?</p>
        <p class="imani">Will you go if I do?</p>
        <p class="imani">Wait. No. Will you go and leave your laptop at home if I do?</p>
        <p class="carmen">Hrm... OK. OK. You've convinced me. No. Your pizza has convinced me!</p>
