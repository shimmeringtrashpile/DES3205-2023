   Notice there are two selectors here separated by a space. 
   The first selector is an ID selector called #recipe-container. 
   The second selector is an element selector called p.
   When two selectors are separated by a space they are called Nested Selectors.
   You can think of this nesting like russian nesting dolls. 
   Reference: https://www.macalester.edu/russian/about/resources/miscellany/matryoshka/
   I have an easier time thinking about how nested selectors work when I read them from right-to-left like this.
