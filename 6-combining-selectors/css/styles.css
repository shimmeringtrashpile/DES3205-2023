/* 
  Lesson 6! Combining Selectors
  I'm going to start with some CSS that might be new to you.
  One of the things you will do a LOT is look at CSS and HTML that has already been written. 
  So let's start doing that now.
  Go ahead and look at your html file and then run it in your browser so you can see the output.
*/


/* Below is a p element selector that sets all of our p element text size to 18px. 
   It is common to see element selectors like this one at the top of a CSS file.
   Element selectors are commonly placed at the top because they are the least specific rules.
   Becuase they are the least specific rule they will likely be applied to a lot of things on your page.
   You might see element selectors that impact: all p elements, all h1, h2 and h3 elements, all div elements, etc.
*/

p {
    font-size: 18px
}


/* These are h1 and h2 element selectors setting the text size. */

h1 {
    font-size: 32px
}

h2 {
    font-size: 28px
}


/* This selector starts with a #. What type of selector is this? 
   Take a look at your html file. What html element is using this selector?
*/

#intro {
    color: powderblue;
    font-size: 20px;
    text-align: center;
    background-color: magenta;
    line-height: 64px
}


/* These are our class selectors for Imani and Carmen's sentences. */

.imani {
    color: blueviolet;
}

.carmen {
    color: orangered;
}


/* We have a DIV element in our HTML with this ID */

#recipe-container {
    width: 80%;
    padding: 18px;
    background-color: rgb(16, 16, 16);
}


/* Recipe-container is a dark background, so we need to style our p text with light-colored text. 

   Also, notice there are two selectors here separated by a space. 
   The first selector is an ID selector called #recipe-container. 
   The second selector is an element selector called p.

   When two selectors are separated by a SPACE they are called Nested Selectors.
   You can think of this nesting like russian nesting dolls. 
   Reference: https://www.macalester.edu/russian/about/resources/miscellany/matryoshka/
   I have an easier time thinking about how nested selectors work when I read them from right-to-left like this.
   "This style will be applied to p elements nested inside my #recipe-container ID."
*/

#recipe-container p {
    color: rgb(190, 190, 190);
    font-size: 16px
}


/* Recipe-container is a dark background so need to style our title text to a light color.
   This style will be applied to title classes nested inside my recipe-container ID.
*/

#recipe-container .title {
    color: white;
    font-size: 28px;
}


/* This style will be applied to subtitle classes nested inside my recipe-container ID. */

#recipe-container .subtitle {
    font-size: 24px
}


/* You will notice this style is two selectors separated by a COMMA. Comma-separated selectors work like an "or."
   This style will be applied to my class .ingredients OR my class .preparation. Both are nested inside my recipe-container ID. */

#recipe-container .ingredients,
#recipe-container .preparation {
    color: white;
    text-transform: uppercase;
}


/* You will notice this style is two selectors separated by a COMMA. Comma-separated selectors work like an "or."
   White color will be applied to ordered lists (ol), also known as numbered lists OR unordered lists (ul) which you might think of as "bulleted lists."
   */

ul,
ol {
    color: white;
