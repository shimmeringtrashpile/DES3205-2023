/* 
  Lesson 5! DIVS
 
  In a previous lesson we learned about 
  element selectors, 
  id selectors and 
  class selectors 
  and we applied all those selectors to p elements.

  There's, of course, a lot more than just p elements! In this lesson we're going to review the most important one to us designers.

  This element is the div element or "division" element!
  
  Divs are probably the most important html element to a designer because they are used to spatially construct things on our pages.
  Div has a very general definition. The best way to think of a div is "a chunk of the page." 
  Because of this general "chunk of stuff" concept, divs are very flexible and are used almost EVERYWHERE and for almost EVERYTHING. 

  We have a div in our html already! Go check out in the index.html file in this lesson. There it is! <div></div>!
  We aren't currently doing anything with this div, so it probably shouldn't be there. 
  That's messy coding practice! But here we are, and there it is so let's use it!

  Divs can have classes and ID attributes just like our p elements. Because of that we can easily create CSS selectors for our divs!
  Let's see what a class might look like on a div and talk about styling that class.
  In our html we have a div with a class 'recipe-card.'

  <div class="recipe-card">

  So let's make an empty class selector that looks like this
  .recipe-card {

  }

  So far, so good!

  Uncomment this .recipe-card class selector and see what happens to our html
*/


/* .recipe-card {
    background-color: lemonchiffon;
    width: 200px;
} */


/* We have a rectangle that looks a lot like a Post-It note.
  Add this line to your class selector above just under the 'width: 200px;' property value pair.

  padding: 20px;
  Take a look at what happened and describe what you're seeing here:


  A thing worth noticing is the top and bottom of the box seeeeeems to have a lot more padding than 20px.
  This is not the padding's fault! This is because the p tags inside the box have a top and bottom margin of 16px, 
  so it just LOOKS like our box has more padding on the top and bottom.

  Use your Google Chrome Developer Toolbar and it's Element Selector to mouse over your p elements and you will see this margin!
  I bring this up because this is a great example of browser defaults doing a thing that feels hidden to you and is making you annoyed.
  You didn't know about this 16px thing and you're stuck. The Dev Toolbar combined with searching the web a lot can really help.
  In Chrome the margin-top (above the element) and margin-bottom (below the element) of the <p> tag is 16px (or 1em).
  In Firefox, only the margin-bottom is 16px.
  Yes! They are different! But we'll get it resolved.

  We have two options here. Either modify our p element margins, or adjust our .recipe-card selector's 20px padding.
  For today, we'll take the easy route and adjust our recipe-card selector's 20px padding.

  The padding property can have different padding amounts assigned for the top, right, left, and bottom of a div.
  'padding: 20px' applies 20px of padding on the top, right, left, and bottom.
  This one number, 20px, is applied to all four sides of the div. But this one number makes our box wonky looking!

  So we need to change our top and bottom padding to accommodate the 16px of top and bottom padding added by our p elements.
  The padding property has got us covered. It supports unique values for top, right, left and bottom! Ah ha!

  So, change your
  padding: 20px;
  to
  padding: 4px 20px 4px 20px;

  And it works! You'll see that we subtracted 16 from our top and bottom numbers.

  There's a few things to know here when working with padding.

  First thing: How do you remember which of the four numbers is top, right, bottom and left?
               I remember this like the face of an analog clock. Start at the top and rotate clockwise.
               12 o'clock, 3 o'clock, 6 o'clock, 9 o'clock.  
               padding: 4px 20px 4px 20px 
               Our first 4px is at the 12 o'clock top position.
               Our first 20px is at the 3 o'clock top position.
               Our second 4px is at the 6 o'clock top position.
               Our second 20px is at the 9 o'clock top position.
  
  Second thing: What if I just want to change the padding ONLY on the left side of my box?
                You can do that! 
                You could do this but it's a bit hard to read.
                padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px

                or you could do
                padding-left: 20px
                Note: padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom all work as well!
  
  Third thing: I've seen padding with just two values. What is that for?
               Sometimes you see a padding values like this:
               
               padding: 10px 40px;

               Remember that the 
               first number 10px is "top and bottom padding" and
               second number 40px is "left and right padding"

               Padding like this is common in things like MS Word documents where the
               right and left margins of the document one height and the
               header and footer spacings of the document are a different width.

/* OK! Now it's your turn.
  We're going to start with some throwback tasks from our old lessons to keep our memory sharp.

  Step 1. Add a recipe-title class to the p element that contains 'My "Put the Pizza in Pizza Party" Pizza'
  Step 2. Add a .recipe-title selector to your css file and add a font-weight: bold property value pair to it.
  Step 3. Change the background color of your div to any color of your choosing. Use the HSL color system.

  The New Stuff Starts Here!
  Step 4. In your html file, add five more recipe card divs with unique title content. 
          Style these divs with the same recipe-card class selector.
  Step 5. Add a margin of 30px to your recipe-card class selector.
  Step 6. Take a look at these changes to your html page using Chrome Dev Toolbar. 
          You might guess that there should be 30 + 30 = 60px of vertical white space between your divs. But there isn't!
          Read this to find out why: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_margin_collapse.asp
  Step 7: Add the 'float: left' property value pair to your recipe-card class selector. 
          Add this property just above the background-color property value pair. That's the common place to put floats.
          What happened to your recipe cards?
