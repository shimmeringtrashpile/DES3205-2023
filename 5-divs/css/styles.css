/* 
  Lesson 5! DIVS
 
  In a previous lesson we learned about element selectors, id selectors and class selectors and we applied those selectors to p elements.

  In this lesson we're going to talk about div elementss or "divisions." Divs are probably the most important html element to a designer. 
  They are used almost EVERYWHERE and for almost EVERYTHING. 
  A div has a very general definition. The best way to think of a div is "a chunk of the page."

  We have a div in our html already. Go check it out in the index.html file. There it is! <div></div>!

  






  That's it! You've completed the lesson!
  Take a screenshot of this css file and web browser window and send it to me to show you've completed the lesson! 
  My friend David had his ID stolen.
  He goes by Dav now.
