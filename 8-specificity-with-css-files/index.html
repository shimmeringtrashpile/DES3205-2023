        Module 8! Specificity with CSS Files 
        First we're going to talk about how our web browsers read CSS files to figure out specificity.
        Look at our link tags below. We have two CSS files named styles.css and then recipe-styles.css.
        CSS files are read top to bottom in order when the page loads. 
        Repeat that out loud: "CSS files are read top to bottom in order when the page loads."
        Seriously, make the word sounds come out of your mouth. "CSS files are read top to bottom in order when the page loads."
        
        So, on our web page first the styles.css is fully read in, then recipe-styles.css is fully read in.
        OK, but why does this matter?
        Let's say you have an 'h3' element selector at the top of styles.css that sets color to red.
        And then you have another 'h3' element selector farther down the styles.css page that sets color to orange, orange will override.
        And then if you have third 'h3' element selector in recipe-styles.css that set color to pink, pink will override.
        Any selectors in recipe-style.css that can override selectors in styles.css WILL.

        Prepare to be suprised at how often this comes up! Ha!

        You can think of it like this. When you open something like Google Docs, your default font is "Arial." 
        When you set the font to "Nunito" you are overriding the default of "Arial." CSS specficity works the same way.
        If "Arial" is set as the h3 font at the top of your first CSS file, and then you set the h3 font to "Nunito" in a second CSS file, 
        your are overriding the first declaration of "Arial." 

        OK! Now it's your turn.
        Step 1. Change the first h3 element selector color in styles.css. Did anything change? If so or if not, why?
        Step 2. Change the second h3 element selector color in styles.css. Did anything change? If so or if not, why?    
        Step 3. Change the h3 element selector color in recipe-styles.css. Did anything change? If so or if not, why?
