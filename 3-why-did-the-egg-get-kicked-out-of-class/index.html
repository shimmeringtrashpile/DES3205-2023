        <p class="imani">I think I'm going to make pizzas and bring them.</p>
        <p class="imani">Hello... Carmen... Are you in there?</p>
        <p class="carmen">Sorry I can't stop thinking about design systems.</p>
        <p class="carmen">I was going to go to the party... But there's a new documentary about Javascript out.</p>
        <p class="carmen">I think Javascript might win over pizza.</p>
        <p class="imani">Wow. You are a serious design nerd.</p>
        <p class="imani">Will you go with me if I let you bring your laptop?</p>
        <p class="carmen">Oh my gosh. Am I that bad?</p>
